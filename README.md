# Sound-Setup
Hereâ€™s a Python program to address your requirements. The program uses the pyaudio library for audio processing and USB audio device detection, numpy for signal analysis, and matplotlib for visual representation. This program requires additional dependencies such as sounddevice for real-time audio monitoring.

Program Overview
Detect USB Mixers: Identify connected audio devices, including your Yamaha MG166CX-USB.
Detect Modes: Output the mode (stereo, mono, or no mode) based on channel configurations.
Real-Time Monitoring:
Identify feedback, noise, or humming sounds.
Detect channels with too hot signals or clipping.
Measure sound levels in decibels (dB).
Highlight any channel with output gain above 0 dB.
ntegrated the sounddevice Device Listing:

At the beginning of the main function, it now prints all available audio devices using sd.query_devices().
This complements the list_audio_devices function from PyAudio.
Improved Structure:

Audio device detection with sounddevice and pyaudio is clearly separated for better debugging and flexibility.
Device Listing Placement:

The new functionality runs first so users can view all devices before detecting and analyzing audio from the USB mixer.
Below is the updated script that incorporates your requirements. It uses ANSI escape codes to output text in different colors (green, orange/yellow, and red) based on the detected dBu levels. This script monitors the signal in real time and displays the corresponding messages accordingly.

Converts dBFS levels to dBu using a configurable threshold (THRESHOLD_DBFS_TO_DBU).
Outputs in green when the signal is exactly 0 dBu, orange when slightly above 0 dBu, and red when above +4 dBu.
Provides real-time feedback on detected signal levels with the correct coloring.
You can adjust THRESHOLD_DBFS_TO_DBU if your dBu calibration differs.
